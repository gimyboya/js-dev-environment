# Introduction

Here is my configuration for my JavaScript development environment.

# Check list

## Editors and Configuration

> **EditorConfig** helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles
>
> â€‹	editorconfig.org

This will reduce the friction in the team and make everyone focusing on coding without having to build new habits.

- [x] .editorconfig

[**EditorConfig**](http://editorconfig.org/) is integrated with webstrom and IntellijIDEA

other text editors can easily integrate it with a plugin such as:

- Atom
- Brackets
- Sublime
- Visual Code
- Vim

and many more

## Building & Automation tool

I use npm as a package manager and an automation tool because of it's rich ecosystem i prefer to use one tool instead of having many tools and configuration files here and there.

- [x] package.json

## Linting

I use [**ESLint**](http://eslint.org/) as it's the most powerful JavaScript linter out there and it's very much customizable and it offers a lot of flexibility and we can create our own rules (very handy in some cases) and very easy to integrate in the work flow and a the editors. 

- [x] .eslintrc
- [x] eslint-config-airbnb

I use[ **Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide**](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to apply the best practices in my projects that are being used by renown companies and developers.
